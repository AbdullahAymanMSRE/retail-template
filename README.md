This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project in which I have turned the retail pagee in this [figma template](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1323934594175224399/deupload-decentralized-cloud-storage-landing-pages) into a live website.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
